* Git Reset:
  Is the command we use when we want to move the repository back to a previous commit, discarding any changes made after that commit.
  There are three types of git reset:
1)Soft reset: 'git reset --soft'
  This preserves changes in your working directory and staging area,allowing you to recommit them.
  (will move the commit file to staging area to commit it).

2)Mixed reset:'git reset --mixed'
  Resets the staging area, but preserves changes in your working directory. You need to add and commit again after this type of reset.
  (will move the commit file to working directory,we need to add and commit to working directory).

3)Hard reset:'git hard --hard'
  Resets both the staging area and the working directory, discarding changes.
  (will delete the last commit,we need to create file,add it,then commit it).

* Git Revert:
  The "git revert" command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit.
->Revert the changes.
->Undo the changes.
->We can get the deleted files again using the commit Id.
   git revert "commit Id"

* git cherry pick "commit Id":To get specific file.

* git Rebase:
  The "git rebase" command is used to combine or modify a sequence of commits to create a linear history. It essentially allows you to move, combine, or delete commits.
   git rebase <rebase> (here, rebase is branch or commit where rebas should start).
