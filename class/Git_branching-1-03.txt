* Git Branching Statements:
  This strategy helps maintain a stable production environment while allowing for ongoing development and the introduction of new features. Adjustments can be made based on the specific needs and scale of a project.
  Git branching strategies are approaches to organizing and managing branches in a collaborative development environment. Here's an overview of a common branching strategy known as Git Flow:
1) Master Branch:
  Represents the production-ready code.Directly reflects the code running in production.

2)Develop Branch:
  Serves as the integration branch for ongoing work.Feature branches are merged into the "develop" branch.

3)Feature Branches:Created for new features or non-trivial changes.Branched off from "develop."Merged back into "develop" when the feature is complete.

4)Release Branches:Created when preparing for a new release.Branched off from "develop."Bug fixes and release-related adjustments are made here.Merged into "master" and "develop" after release.

5)Hotfix Branches:Created to fix critical issues in the production code.Branched off from "master."Merged into both "master" and "develop."
