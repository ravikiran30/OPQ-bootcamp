Git is used to collaborate on code.

Clone a project to work on a local copy
Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
Push local updates to the main project


Commands-----------
mkdir [folder_name]---------to make new directory
cd [file_name]----------------to change the current working directory
git init------------to initialize git repository
ls--------to list the files in the directory
git status----Git is aware of the file, but has not added it to our repository!
Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository



Git Architecture-----------

				repository
git commit file.txt
		^
		|		staging area
git add file.txt
		^		
		|	working(local area)


Three-tree architecture in Git: The working directory (containing changes that may not be tracked by Git), the staging index (containing changes that are about to be committed into the repository), and the repository (being tracked by Git). 
When we finish working with our files in the project, commit them to the staging stage and then push them to the repository.
